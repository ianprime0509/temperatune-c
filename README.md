# Temperatune

This is a (work-in-progress) adaptation of a [web
app](https://ianprime0509.github.io/temperatune) that I made, implementing
a basic musical instrument tuner with support for temperaments. More
documentation will be forthcoming, as well as the primary goal of
implementing the actual tuner (detecting pitch from audio input versus
just producing a pitch).
